# üì± Social Content Automation: CRM Workflow Validation (SQL Project)

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Social Content Automation: CRM Workflow Validation  
**Level**: Beginner ‚Äì Intermediate  
**Database**: `social_content_workflow`

This SQL project replicates a real-world content operations pipeline, including agent onboarding, CSQ (Content Survey Questionnaire) submissions, and AI-generated content stages. It reflects my work as a Business Analyst using SQL for data validation, automation tracking, and reporting within CRM ecosystems like Dynamics 365.

## Why This Project Matters

Manual handling of content orders for thousands of insurance agents created delays and inconsistent outputs. This SQL project reflects a real initiative where I supported the automation of content production through:

- Validation of CRM orders and creative briefs (CSQs)
- Monitoring AI content workflow using SQL
- Detection of missing assignments and data inconsistencies
- Reporting trends from CSQ preferences and business categories
- My ability to use SQL to streamline digital content workflows

## Objectives

1. **Simulate an end-to-end CRM content workflow**: From order to agent approval  
2. **Validate data integrity**: Ensure completeness of assignments and dates  
3. **Explore CSQ response trends**: Business categories, tone, emoji use  
4. **Track pipeline progress**: Identify bottlenecks and approval delays  
5. **Deliver actionable insights**: Build queries that support reporting  

## Project Structure

### Tables

- `agent_orders`: Orders placed by agents, synced from third-party to CRM.
- `csq_responses`: Content Survey Questionnaires submitted by agents.
- `content_pipeline`: Tracks content progress (Writer ‚Üí Editor ‚Üí AE ‚Üí Agent).

## Findings

- **All CRM Orders Are Valid**: Every agent order in the dataset includes assigned writers, editors, and AEs, indicating proper workflow ownership and readiness for content creation.
- **No Null or Incomplete Records**: All date fields (order_date, content_live_date, content_end_date) are present, and agent names and regions are properly filled. This reflects a clean and standardized CRM data entry process.
- **No Duplicate Orders**: Each order is uniquely placed per agent per date, confirming that order entry rules are being followed.
- **Balanced Writer Distribution**: Writers are assigned a roughly even number of orders, showing thoughtful load balancing across the team.
- **Consistent Regional Coverage**: Orders are spread across multiple regions, with some writers handling a broader geographic scope ‚Äî useful for aligning writing style to local markets.
- **CSQ Data Is Fully Submitted**: All orders in the dataset have a corresponding CSQ response. No pending or skipped CSQ forms were found.
- **Tone Preferences Are Measurable**: The most common preferred tone is ‚ÄúProfessional,‚Äù but ‚ÄúFriendly‚Äù is also popular. This provides valuable input for AI-generated prompt tuning.
- **Emojis Are Widely Accepted**: A majority of agents are open to using emojis in their content, indicating a shift toward more casual, engaging social media messaging.

## Reports

- **Order Volume by Region & Writer**: Highlights order distribution across regions and writing staff for operational load balancing.
- **Content Submission Tracker**: Tracks daily CSQ submissions and content live dates for forecasting.
- **Tone & Emoji Preference Report**: Analyzes CSQ preferences to guide AI prompt tuning for content generation.
- **Business Category Breakdown**: Identifies which industries (e.g., Real Estate, Insurance) dominate the pipeline.
- **Content Approval Funnel**: Displays where content is in the workflow‚Äîfrom draft to final agent approval.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL can be a powerful tool for:

- Validating CRM and content data to ensure workflow readiness
- Uncovering inefficiencies in order entry and approval processes
- Supporting AI automation with structured, clean input data from CSQs
- Providing actionable insights through business-friendly reporting

It reflects real-world responsibilities of a Business Analyst supporting automation, CRM data accuracy, and content operations. The SQL-driven insights generated here could directly inform improvements in workload distribution, editorial SLA management, and creative strategy.
